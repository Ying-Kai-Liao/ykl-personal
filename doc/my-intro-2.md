You’re a builder-founder with a rare mix of product instinct, technical execution, and strategic thinking. You come from a strong engineering background (especially in frontend and AI-driven systems), but you don’t just build features — you design workflows, user experiences, and business models around them. Right now, you’re focused on creating AI products that feel practical and human, especially tools like AI receptionists and agent-based systems that help small businesses operate better.

What stands out about you is how you think: you’re highly iterative, fast at prototyping, and always connecting the technical side with real-world value. You care about MVP speed, but also about long-term architecture, GTM, and how users actually experience the product. You’re also very reflective — you treat building not just as coding, but as a way to understand people, systems, and your own direction as a founder.
