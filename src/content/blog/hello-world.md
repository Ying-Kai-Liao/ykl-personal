If you're reading this, welcome! I'm Kai — a developer and startup builder currently based in Sydney, studying Data Science and Innovation at UTS.

#### Why start a blog?

I've spent the past few years building things — web apps, iOS apps, AI tools, a startup — and I've learned a lot along the way. But most of that knowledge lives in scattered notes, half-finished docs, and my own head. This blog is my attempt to change that.

Writing helps me think more clearly, and sharing what I learn keeps me accountable. Whether it's a deep dive into a technical problem, reflections on building products, or just something interesting I came across — I want a place to put it all.

#### What to expect

- **AI and LLMs** — practical applications, tools I'm building, things I've learned working with Claude, GPT, and other models
- **Full-stack development** — TypeScript, Next.js, React, Swift, and whatever else I'm working with
- **Data science** — projects from my MDSI studies, interesting datasets, and analysis techniques
- **Startup lessons** — what I learned from founding 攀木科技 (PemoChart) and going through the U-start accelerator
- **Side projects and reflections** — the fun stuff that keeps me up at night, and the thoughts that come with it

Now, before we get into the tech stuff in future posts, I want to share something more personal first.

#### Going with the Flow

How do you get to know me? I'm someone who's taken a lot of detours.

Constant questioning, constant curiosity — that's what shaped who I am today. But it also means I've spent a lot of time verifying things most people take for granted. As a kid, when I didn't understand why science explained things a certain way, I'd go and try it myself. As I got older, my doubts shifted to bigger questions — about education, about what makes a life worth living.

Growing up in Taiwan's education system, I felt like everything had a right answer. Every exam had a score, every effort had a grade. Being a "good student" meant good grades — and good grades made you a good child, a good son, a good person. Teachers praised you, parents supported you, classmates admired you. Why wouldn't you chase that?

But the chase warped something inside me. I started to believe that anything outside of academics — art, hobbies, fun — was a waste of time. If a classmate chose to pursue something creative instead of studying, I'd think they were throwing their future away. I'm not proud of that.

The pressure built. I'd blame myself for careless mistakes on exams, feel guilty for watching a movie, convince myself that vacations were stolen time because I wasn't studying something extra. Every spare moment that wasn't "productive" felt like a failure. I was someone desperately trying to go with the flow — the flow of grades, rankings, and validation.

Everything shifted when I enlisted for military service. Everyone told me it would be the most boring, most wasted time of my life. But two weeks in, I realized it was the most peaceful and happiest time I'd ever had. No more worrying about whether I was wasting time — because everyone was doing the same four months. No more asking myself if I'd done enough.

In that quiet, something clicked. I made a decision: **I want to live in a place without scores.**

After that, I started seeing things differently. I dropped out, traded stocks, came back to school at NTUST, took a full-time game developer job while still a student — faking it until I made it, as Jobs would say. I learned that grinding with pure effort and sacrificing my health wasn't the life I wanted. I quit. I understood that credentials exist so you don't have to constantly prove what you can do.

Then came the harder question: **what do I actually want?**

I like solving problems, exploring the world, and learning continuously. Freelancing was a natural fit, but I wanted more. So I started building tools — software that anyone could use. In my mind, it was no different from someone inventing a wrench or a hammer. A tool is just a shape that solving a problem takes. When it solves enough people's problems, it becomes a product. When it becomes foundational, it becomes part of culture.

So here I am — a product developer, building tools that help people think. Starting with myself, and hopefully reaching others who also like taking the long way around. Whether anyone else buys in, I don't know. But my own life already has.

I think "going with the flow" means accepting values — worldly, unexamined values — without questioning them. If that starts to cause pain, and you trace the pain back to its source and reflect on it, maybe you can break free. Or maybe you just find the next current that fits you better.

The truth is, I might still be going with the flow right now. I just haven't seen through it yet. And maybe that's the whole point — life is less about escaping the current and more about constantly finding the one that's truly yours.
