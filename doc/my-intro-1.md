Hey, I'm Kai — a solo founder and software developer based in Sydney, currently building Agent Firmware, a platform that creates AI receptionists for small businesses like dental clinics and real estate agencies. Think of it less like a chatbot tool and more like hiring an AI employee through a conversation.
I've worn a lot of hats across my career — from exploring enterprise tech in Taiwan to navigating the messy, exciting early stages of building a bootstrapped startup. I care deeply about understanding problems at a first-principles level before jumping to solutions, which shapes how I build and how I think.
Beyond the technical side, I'm genuinely fascinated by where AI is taking us — the architecture, the implications, the way it's reshaping what it means to be a developer. I write about these things because thinking out loud helps me figure out what I actually believe.
If you're a small business owner curious about AI, a fellow founder in the trenches, or just someone who likes thinking about hard problems — you're probably in the right place.
