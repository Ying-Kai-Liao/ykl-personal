I'm Ying-Kai Liao (YK) — a builder and developer based in Taipei, Taiwan.

I studied at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), and I've been building things across the full stack ever since — from web apps and iOS apps to AI tools and data science pipelines.

### What I Do

I'm drawn to the intersection of **AI and real-world applications**. Some highlights:

- Built **hot-seat**, a Claude Code skill that puts product ideas through rigorous AI-powered critique
- Developed a **multimodal skin cancer report and recommendation system** using the HAM10000 dataset
- Created **TouchStone**, an iOS app for AI-powered project decomposition using Claude Agent SDK
- Previously founded **攀木科技 (PemoChart)**, a startup awarded at U-start Plan 16th

### My Stack

I work primarily with **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **React**, **Python**, and **Swift**. I've built LINE Bots, Discord bots, IoT projects, healthcare applications, and various AI/LLM-powered tools.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, tinkering with side projects, or thinking about how technology can make a meaningful impact — especially in healthcare.

Feel free to reach out through any of my socials — I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.
