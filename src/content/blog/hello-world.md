If you're reading this, welcome! I'm Kai — a developer and startup builder currently based in Sydney, studying Data Science and Innovation at UTS.

## Why start a blog?

I've spent the past few years building things — web apps, iOS apps, AI tools, a startup — and I've learned a lot along the way. But most of that knowledge lives in scattered notes, half-finished docs, and my own head. This blog is my attempt to change that.

Writing helps me think more clearly, and sharing what I learn keeps me accountable. Whether it's a deep dive into a technical problem, reflections on building products, or just something interesting I came across — I want a place to put it all.

## What to expect

Here's a rough idea of what I'll be writing about:

- **AI and LLMs** — practical applications, tools I'm building, things I've learned working with Claude, GPT, and other models
- **Full-stack development** — TypeScript, Next.js, React, Swift, and whatever else I'm working with
- **Data science** — projects from my MDSI studies, interesting datasets, and analysis techniques
- **Startup lessons** — what I learned from founding 攀木科技 (PemoChart) and going through the U-start accelerator
- **Side projects** — the fun stuff that keeps me up at night

## A bit about my setup

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind CSS. It's fast, simple, and gives me full control over the design. Blog posts are written in Markdown — no CMS, no database, just files in a git repo.
